# How to Publish Research Software

Notes based on the course ["Foundation of Research Software Publication"](https://events.hifis.net/event/1344/overview) by the [Helmholtz Information and Data Science Academy (HIDA)](https://www.helmholtz-hida.de/) on 2024/05/23 and /24.

Original course material is available via [Git](https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/hifis/software/education/hifis-workshops/foundations-of-research-software-publication/workshop-materials) and [HedgeDoc](https://notes.desy.de/rVHUTRVsTR2qVTiXjrDHCg?view).

## Overview

How should I publish my research-related code (and data) to enable others to check, reproduce, or reuse my results?

1. [Put the results in a version-controlled repository](chapters/1_version_control.md)
2. [Create a shareable state](chapters/2_shareable_state.md)
3. [Add essential documentation](chapters/3_essential_documentation.md)
4. [Add a license](chapters/4_license.md)
5. [Make the artifact citable](chapters/5_citation.md)
6. [Release the repository](chapters/6_release.md)

Consider [this GitHub repo](https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/hifis/software/education/hifis-workshops/foundations-of-research-software-publication/astronaut-analysis-data) and its branches as an evoling example for these six steps.
