## Typical Documentation Files

- `README.md` as entry point to the repository with the following information:
  - Short description of the repository (What? Why?)
  - Installation and configuration instructions
  - Usage instructions
  - Test instructions
  - Project/code architecture details
  - Link to changelog + eventually info about latest update
  - Link to contribution guidelines
  - Link to code of conduct
  - Link to license
  - Citation information
- `CONTRIBUTING`
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`
- `LICENSE` file for the entire project, or a description of all (third-party) licenses in the `LICENSE` file and a `LICENSES` folder that lists all licenses.
- `CHANGELOG`
